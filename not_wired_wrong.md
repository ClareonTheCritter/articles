# I am not wired wrong. There is nothing wrong with me. I am not any lesser than another, nor do I have any greater potential.

What I was, was *confused.* Having lost myself in a world where the majority of people seemed to turn a blind eye to things such as abuse, the destruction of our planet, exploitation of the young, the elderly and minority. I must have been the one who was insane for caring, *right?*

My unshakeable stances on justice, my black and white views? It's all because I can see what most choose not to. I wasn't able to turn away.

My eyes could not be clouded to the misery and injustices of the world. I became depressed. I tried to turn away. I fell into addictions, distractions, self harm and self loathing. Anything to escape myself and yet I could not.

Anything to be like everyone else who, despite everything, seemed to be able to function. They might even be happy. I *could not.* And many of them are not happy after all.

## I am not wired wrong. I am not lesser.

I am free to do with my wiring as I please. It is those who we call neurotypical that are stuck in the programming forced into them since birth that are wired wrong. Wired against their will.

The *culprit?* A shadowy cabal? A secret world government? The police state?

No, sadly, it's society itself. In all of it's best intentions to do good for itself it has become trapped in an insane loop of ever hurried progress at the expense of all else. Never having left the false comforts of endless hording of resources and advances in discoveries in the vain hopes of staving off the *inevitable end* that comes for all creatures.

The neurotypical wavelength continues to perpetuate harmful and self destructive tendencies that were once what made the human line strong. That allowed our particular pool of genes to come out on top among all others. Humans who became the champions of life, rising to the top of the food chain. Only to discover in the end that there was no victory to be wrestled from the cold boney jaws of death.

I am here to help free them from this cycle. Whatever made me this way has allowed me to see beyond the *illusions*. All for the purpose of helping others through it.

Some autistics have managed to mask better than others. To blend in and forget. I don't think any of us have truly managed to do so wholly.

Some allistics have broken free from their programming, becoming neurodivergent. They may be the strongest out of all of us.

## I am not wired wrong. I do not have a greater potential.

…This isn't to say that I do not struggle. Being who I am in this world is rife with challenges. How hard it is to convince others who have learned to abdicate their own needs and desires that -I- have needs. Those who have dulled themselves to the richness of the human experience who can not understand how certain sensations could be difficult or harmful.

Once, they hurt too. The human mantra is to overcome. To not be 'weak' because being weak meant you were eaten. So they ate their feelings and emotions and asked the same of me. But I could not. Not convincingly anyways.

And it has been lonely too. That is the worst of the pain. Feeling alone in this world and honestly believing that no one out there is anything like me.

I know now, that nobody is like me. But there are lots out there who share similar feelings to me.

And that every human, whatever their neurologically wired disposition, are capable of these feelings too. They yearn to be *free* of their wiring. To make choices and live their own lives. To live joyfully and honestly and cooperatively. To help create an open, accepting and just world. This is the gift I am to share with the world.
